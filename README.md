## Overview

Startup School is a peer-to-peer learning program designed specifically for new UNBOXD members who lack direction and entrepreneurial experience. Our goal is to educate and mentor these members to the point where they have honed in on a problem and ideated a solution which they keep developing as an active project. 

Think of Startup School as the **opposite of a hackathon**. Instead of making you **cram a solution in a few days**, we want to work with founders across multiple academic terms to **sustainably develop their ideas**.

Instead of focusing on prizes and funding, we teach founders to make the most of the resources already available to them.


### Goals

1. To give curious but inexperienced UNBOXD members an actionable framework for ideating, testing, and developing startup ideas. 
2. To create a roster of potential startup founders with promising projects.

### Mechanics

Enrollees in the program will be onboarded onto one of two learning paths:

- Tech for Non-Tech
- Hacker School
- Social Enterprise

To supplement the MOOCs, Startup School will also incorporate relevant events and hackathons from the startup community and field visits to offices of local startups/incubators, so that the students develop a holistic (and realistic) perspective of what building a startup involves. 

This first run of Startup School  will culminate with Demo Day at Launchgarage where our prospective founders will present pitch decks outlining their projects, for judging by experts from the startup and social enterprise space.
